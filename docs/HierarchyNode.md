# GeoSearch::HierarchyNode

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **geoname_id** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **name** | **String** |  | [optional] |
| **type** | **String** |  | [optional] |
| **depth** | **Integer** | THE DIRECTION DEPENDS ON THE ENDPOINT, because this schema is shared by two operations that number their nodes from opposite ends.  On &#x60;GET /v1/cities/{id}/hierarchy&#x60; depth counts UP from the entity asked about: &#x60;depth: 0&#x60; is the city and the country carries the HIGHEST depth. On &#x60;GET /v1/resolve&#x60; depth is POSITIONAL, counting outward-in: &#x60;depth: 0&#x60; is the COUNTRY. Code that sorts or indexes on this field across both endpoints without accounting for the inversion silently REVERSES the hierarchy rather than failing — &#x60;max(by: depth)&#x60; returns the country on one and the innermost region on the other.  On &#x60;/v1/resolve&#x60; depth is the ARRAY INDEX and NOT an administrative level. A chain may skip a level: a measured 3.8% of coordinates resolve to a country plus a level-2 region with no level-1 region, and in those &#x60;depth: 1&#x60; is a level-2 area. &#x60;HierarchyNode&#x60; carries no &#x60;level&#x60; field, so there is no second signal to disambiguate with — treat depth as position only. | [optional] |

require 'geosearch'

instance = GeoSearch::HierarchyNode.new(
  geoname_id: 5391959,
